                            <p class="infAbotMe">From a young age, football was an integral part of my life, but as the years went by, my interests began to expand. Alongside training on the field, I started dedicating time to computer graphics and programming, discovering the fascinating world of technology. While football remained my passion, I always had a curiosity for new knowledge and possibilities.

                                After completing junior academy at Step Academy, I decided to continue my education at the university level, where I could explore my potential in the field of information technology. Alongside my studies, I independently delved into web development skills, aiming to broaden my horizons and apply new knowledge in practice.
                                
                                Today, as a student in Poland, I am actively studying IT management. My constant thirst for new knowledge and my drive for professional growth led me to pursue an additional course in software testing automation at LemonSchool. This experience has allowed me to enhance my skills and delve deeper into the world of technology, as well as discover new career prospects.
                                
                                My journey is one of striving for self-improvement and continuous development in the field that inspires me. I am ready to embrace any challenges that my future holds and to use my knowledge and experience to succeed in the chosen field.</p>
