Test Cases, Bug Reports & SQL Queries Repository

Welcome to my Test Cases, Bug Reports, and SQL Queries repository! This project showcases my skills and experience in writing detailed and structured test cases, bug reports, and SQL queries. It reflects my understanding of software testing processes and database querying, demonstrating proficiency in documenting scenarios, steps, and outcomes in an organized manner, as well as working with databases.

📂 Repository Structure
test-cases/: A collection of test cases written to verify various functionalities, following industry-standard formats. Each test case includes preconditions, steps to reproduce, expected results, and postconditions.

bug-reports/: Bug reports documenting issues found during testing, with information such as severity, priority, steps to reproduce, actual vs. expected results, and environmental details.

sql-queries/: Contains SQL queries used for database testing, data manipulation, and extraction. These queries demonstrate my ability to interact with relational databases, execute complex queries, and perform data validation and verification.

🚀 Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to demonstrate my proficiency in software testing (manual and automated) and SQL for database-related tasks. The test cases and bug reports highlight my attention to detail and structured approach, while the SQL queries show my ability to work with data efficiently.

📋 Contents
